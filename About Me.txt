About Me

Hello, I'm Alex Somers. 

I'm originally from NB but moved to Edmonton in 2019. I'm currently 28 and originally applied to the Sysadmin stream
I am very close with my grandmother who recently turned 94 and is hoping to come visit me in the next few years.
This will be her 3rd time on a plane if she is able to come. I'm a big fan of games and am currently obsessed with
the RPG "Metaphor: Re Fantazio" which is a game that takes inspiration from the 1516 novel Utopia and the art of
Hieronymus Bosch to tell a story about anxiety, the potential of average people, the effect fantasy can have on people, and
the need to always strive for utopia despite how unreachable it may seem. I'm also a big fan of History, with my
favourite period being WW1. It's complicated and generally depressing, however I find it fascinating to see the clashing
of new technology and old tactics. I also love despite the terrible conditions there are many songs (mostly parodys
of military or pub songs) sung by the Tommies, it gives a hopeful optimistic feeling despite the conditions.
I'm a member of game dev club, and now that I'm no longer working 30 hours a week on top of my classes, I'm eager
to join more clubs. I'm planning to make my own game (a ww1 inspired strategy game) with the assistance of my girlfriend.
I have a cat named Albert Whiskers and my girlfriend has a snake named Apollo.
